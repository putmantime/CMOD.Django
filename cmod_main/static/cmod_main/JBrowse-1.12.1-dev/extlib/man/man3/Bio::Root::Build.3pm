.IX Title "Bio::Root::Build 3"
.TH Bio::Root::Build 3 "2016-07-01" "perl v5.18.2" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.\" For nroff, turn off justification.  Always turn off hyphenation; it makes
.\" way too many mistakes in technical documents.

.Vb 1
\&  ...TO BE ADDED

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a subclass of Module::Build so we can override certain methods and do
fancy stuff
.PP
It was first written against Module::Build::Base v0.2805. Many of the methods
here are copy/pasted from there in their entirety just to change one or two
minor things, since for the most part Module::Build::Base code is hard to
cleanly override.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: per bug 3196, the majority of the code in this module has been revised
or commented out to bring it in line with the Module::Build \s-1API.\s0 In particular,
\&'requires/recommends' tags in the Build.PL file were not of the same format as
those for Module::Build, and so caused serious issues with newer versions
(including giving incorrect meta data). Other problematic methods involving
automatic installation of prereq modules via \s-1CPAN\s0 were also removed as they do
not work with more modern perl tools such as perlbrew and cpanm.
.SS "find_pm_files"
.IX Subsection "find_pm_files"
Our modules are in Bio, not lib
.SS "choose_scripts"
.IX Subsection "choose_scripts"
Ask what scripts to install (this method is unique to bioperl)
.SS "script_files"
.IX Subsection "script_files"
Our version of script_files doesn't take args but just installs those scripts
requested by the user after \fIchoose_scripts()\fR is called. If it wasn't called,
installs all scripts in scripts directory
.SS "prompt"
.IX Subsection "prompt"
Overridden simply to not print the default answer if chosen by hitting return
.SS "find_dist_packages"
.IX Subsection "find_dist_packages"
Like the Module::Build version, except that we always get version from
dist_version
.SS "ACTION_manifest"
.IX Subsection "ACTION_manifest"
We always generate a new \s-1MANIFEST\s0 instead of allowing existing files to remain
\&\s-1MANIFEST.SKIP\s0 is left alone
.SS "ACTION_install"
.IX Subsection "ACTION_install"
Extended to run scripts post-installation
.SS "test_internet"
.IX Subsection "test_internet"
For use with auto_features, which should require LWP::UserAgent as one of
its reqs
.PP
Note: as of 4\-11\-11, this is no longer called \- if someone wants to run
network tests (off by default) w/o a network, then they are hanging themselves
by their own shoelaces.
.SS "dist_dir"
.IX Subsection "dist_dir"
Nice directory names for dist-related actions
.SS "ACTION_ppmdist"
.IX Subsection "ACTION_ppmdist"
Don't copy across man3 docs since they're of little use under Windows and
have bad filenames
.SS "install_types"
.IX Subsection "install_types"
When supplied a true value, pretends libdoc doesn't exist (preventing man3
installation for ppmdist). when supplied false, they exist again
.SS "ACTION_dist"
.IX Subsection "ACTION_dist"
We make all archive formats we want, not just .tar.gz
we also auto-run manifest action, since we always want to re-create
\&\s-1MANIFEST\s0 and \s-1MANIFEST.SKIP\s0 just-in-time
.SS "ACTION_clean"
.IX Subsection "ACTION_clean"
Define custom clean/realclean actions to rearrange config file cleanup
.SS "ACTION_realclean"
.IX Subsection "ACTION_realclean"
Define custom clean/realclean actions to rearrange config file cleanup
.SS "make_zip"
.IX Subsection "make_zip"
Makes zip file for windows users and bzip2 files as well
.SS "prompt_for_network"
.IX Subsection "prompt_for_network"
A method that can be called in a Build.PL script to ask the user if they want
internet tests.
Should only be called if you have tested for yourself that
\&\f(CW$build\fR\->feature('Network Tests') is true
.SS "print_build_script"
.IX Subsection "print_build_script"
Override the build script warnings flag
